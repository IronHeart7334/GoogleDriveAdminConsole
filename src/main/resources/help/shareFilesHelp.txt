Use this plugin to distribute Google Drive files to people.
To the left, you will see 2 property file choosers; one says "User Spreadsheet info", while the other says "File Spreadsheet info".
You'll want to select property file's you've created using the "create sheet properties" plugin for both of these.
Once you've selected the appropriate files, you may want to un-check the "this is just a test" checkbox on the bottom of the screen, or you can leave it checked to see exactly which files the program will share, and who it will share them with.
Either way, once you select the files, you can click the "Run" button to share the files.
The program will read the file sheet referenced by the "File Spreadsheet info", and find which groups each file should be given to.
It then reads the user sheet referenced by the "User Spreadsheet info", and finds which groups each user belongs to.
Then, each user is given view access to each file in their group.
